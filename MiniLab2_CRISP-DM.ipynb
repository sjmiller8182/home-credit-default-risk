    "We will use the Home Credit Default Risk dataset made available on Kaggle to develop a useful model that predicts loan defaults for a majority of the loan applicants whose population is defined by the given training and test datasets. Predicting loan defaults is essential to the profitability of banks and, given the competitive nature of the loan market, a bank that collects the right data can offer and service more loans. This analysis of Home Credit's Default Risk dataset will focus on generating accurate loan default risk probabilities, identifying sub-populations among the given applicants, and finally, the most critical factors that indicate that an applicant will likely default on their loan.\n",
