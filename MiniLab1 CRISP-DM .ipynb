Predicting loan defaults is essential to the profitability of banks and, given the competitive nature of the loan market, a bank that collects the right data can offer and service more loans.

    "    -  Home Credit seeks to service those who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit's customer base consists of high-risk applicants, but the lender seeks to provide this high-need population with a trustworthy source of much-needed credit. Home Credit aims to find the right balance between risk and rewards in an inherently risky applicant pool.\n",

    "- Benefits\n",
    "  -  Home Credit is broadening financial inclusion, extending credit to unbanked populations, while providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. Identifying the characteristics that inevitably lead to positive and negative loan experiences to customers without an established repayment history requires the use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities. Each customer that Home Credit identifies gains otherwise rare opportunity, while Home Credit gains the capital that other potential customers will use for their pursuits."

    "**Financial Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that financial features, such as an applicant's reported annual income (`AMT_INCOME_TOTAL`), will be important to the analysis as leading indicators of the applicant's ability to successfully repay a loan. From a business perspective, smaller incomes customers will necessitate more automated decisions due to the small individual profit potential that each loan represents. Large incomes, however, may receive special treatment due not only to their outlier status, but to the larger profit margins Home Credit can expect as their loans are repaid. An analysis of income distributions will assist us in determining an appropriate categorization of loan applicants to optimize the ratio of time spent to profit potential based on income and loan size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AMT_INCOME_TOTAL**\n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of visualization, AMT_INCOME_TOTAL was transformed with log base-10.\n",
    "This is due to influence from some very large observations on histogram binning.\n",
    "As shown in the pair of plots for AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, most of the values are clustered just above 100,000 (5).\n",
    "The main section of the log transformed distribution appears to relatively close to a normal (the distribution is right-skewed on the original scale).\n",
    "Several extreme values are shown in the box plot.\n",
    "The most extreme value is approximately 1000 times larger than the median and mean of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AMT_ANNUITY**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_ANNUITY has a right skewed distribution.\n",
    "However, this feature could be plotted on the original scale because the scale is not as large as AMT_INCOME_TOTAL.\n",
    "The histogram shows that most of the values are between 0 and 50,000.\n",
    "The boxplot shows that there are some exteme values outside the main distribution.\n",
    "The largest extreme value is approximately 10 times the median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the finacial features we expect that some kind of transformation may be necessary to reduce the influence of the extreme values.\n",
    "We may also consider removing very large outliers as they may be treated differently by the bank.\n",
    "For instance, clients with very large incomes may be work personally with a bank representative rather than interacting with an automated system."

While there may be some potential minimization of categorical importance from this approach (through introducing more parameters and slightly dilluting the correlation), any residual collinearity following variable elimination would be likewise minimized by further separating significance of categorical variables in preference to other collinear, continuous and nominally scaled integer features.\n",

We decided to analyze 15 features for outlier removal due to the exponentially decaying significance of subsequent features to the target and the negative impact of removing too many observations. We performed analysis on these 15 features using histograms to assess dispersion and measured skewness on all transformed features to identify the most practical transformations (root, logarithmic, squared) required for normalization. Skewness around +/-1 was considered extreme, between +/-0.5 as moderate, and 0 as non-existent.

This approach was selected because three standard deviations covers roughly 99.78% of all data, eliminating only extreme outliers. Three standard deviations is also within a reliable range for hypothesis testing. After dropping outlying observations from the data, we then back-transformed it to allow prior knowledge in the data to remain for its use in classification modeling.\n",
