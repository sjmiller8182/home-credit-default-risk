In this case, our response classes – which refer to loan default status – are binary with a loan default represented with the integer 1 and non-default represented as integer 0. The logistic regression model utilizes an odds ratio, which represents the probability of an event occurring rather than an event not occurring.  In the case of this classification model, the event – also called a “positive event” – is a representation of a loan being defaulted. The produced odds ratio is then transformed logarithmically into a probability ranging from 0 to 1. Because there is a binary split in the classification of our output, the threshold for determining if a positive event has occurred or not is 0.5.\n",
